           <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> In my previous role, my manager pointed out that while my reports were detailed, they  were sometimes too long and difficult for stakeholders to scan quickly.  Initially, I felt I had put in so much effort, but I realized feedback was valid.  I learned to present key points in concise bullet points and move the detailed analysis to  an appendix.

And third, I ask Kershans from inexperienced colleagues  to fill knowledge gaps.  For example, when I had to learn a new CRM model,  I took online tutorials, explained test data  in the sandbox environment and writing a week.  I was comfortable enough to train others.</div>

Initially, it was challenging to maintain the same level of interaction, but I set up  structured daily check-ins and I learned to use tools like Trello and Zoom effectively as  a result, our team's productivity actually improved and we were able to deliver projects  from the city.</div>
