It focuses on perceived unfairness in credit allocation rather than demonstrating flexibility or change-readiness.

This shifts blame and avoids personal accountability for any mistakes.</div></td></tr><tr><td>KnowItAll</td><td>6.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The response focuses on past accomplishments and perceived unfairness in credit distribution, rather than explicitly expressing a willingness to learn or seek guidance. While not overtly dismissive, the lack of focus on personal growth or learning opportunities suggests a neutral tone, placing it in the 6-7 range. The phrase "it's okay like they can also suit them to the next project" implies a passive acceptance rather than a proactive learning approach.</div></td></tr><tr><td>FeedbackAcceptance</td><td>4.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The response is difficult to understand and doesn't clearly describe receiving and acting on constructive criticism. The candidate mentions a situation where team members didn't receive credit, but it's unclear if this is related to feedback or performance. The phrase "it's okay like they can also suit them to the next project" suggests a passive acceptance of the situation rather than active improvement based on feedback.</div></td></tr><tr><td>SupportGrowth</td><td>4.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The response is vague and focuses on a perceived lack of recognition for others, but doesn't describe any concrete actions the candidate took to support them or address the situation. The phrase "it's okay like they can also suit them to the next project for looking forward regarding those minutes" suggests a passive acceptance rather than active support.</div></td></tr></tbody>
