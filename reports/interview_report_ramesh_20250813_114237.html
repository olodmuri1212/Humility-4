The outdated data example includes admitting the mistake, informing the manager, and creating a checklist to prevent future errors.

After that, I created a quick verification checklist for myself before sending any reports."</div></td></tr><tr><td>MindChange</td><td>7.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate describes several instances where they adapted their approach based on feedback or new information, such as shortening reports after feedback ('my manager pointed out that my reports were detailed...I analyzed that feedback was valid'), changing their communication style during remote work ('I had to quickly adapt to what we should do and new communication methods'), and creating a verification checklist after sending a report with outdated data ('I created a quick verification checklist for myself'). These examples demonstrate a willingness to learn and adjust their behavior, indicating intellectual flexibility.</div></td></tr><tr><td>LearnerMindset</td><td>6.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The response is a mix of different learning experiences, not specifically focused on learning from someone junior. While there are examples of learning and adaptation, the prompt asked specifically about learning from someone *junior*. The response includes examples of learning from a manager, from mistakes, and from adapting to remote work, but lacks a clear, substantial example of learning from a junior colleague. The phrase 'Rather than escalating immediately, I had one or one conversation to understand the issue. It turned out they were struggling with the technical part of the task. I hope for the paddock for a couple of recesses to guide them and be structured the work.' hints at a potential learning experience,</div></td></tr><tr><td>BragFlag</td><td>6.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>While the response focuses on learning and improvement, the phrase "within a week I was comfortable within to train other people also" suggests a degree of self-congratulation.</div></td></tr><tr><td>BlameShift</td><td>8.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate primarily focuses on their own actions and learning, such as 'I analyzed that feedback was valid.

While the manager's initial feedback is mentioned, the response centers on self-improvement and problem-solving.</div></td></tr><tr><td>KnowItAll</td><td>7.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The response focuses on personal learning and adaptation, acknowledging mistakes and improvements. While there's a slight tendency to present solutions as personal achievements, there's no overt condescension or dismissal of others' perspectives. Phrases like 'I analyzed that feedback was valid' and 'I learnt so much' suggest self-reflection rather than a 'know-it-all' attitude.</div></td></tr><tr><td>FeedbackAcceptance</td><td>8.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate provides multiple specific examples of receiving feedback and acting upon it, such as shortening reports based on stakeholder feedback ('The policy was bullet points and all the details and this was bullet dependence'), helping a struggling colleague ('I hope for the paddock for a couple of recesses to guide them and be structured the work'), and creating a verification checklist after sending a report with outdated data ('After that, I created a quick verification checklist for myself before sending any reports').</div></td></tr><tr><td>SupportGrowth</td><td>7.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate mentions guiding a struggling teammate and structuring their work: "I hope for the paddock for a couple of recesses to guide them and be structured the work."

          <div class="q">Q1. 1) Can you tell me about a time when you received constructive criticism? How did you handle it?</div>
          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> In my previous rule, my manager pointed out that my reports were detailed.  They were sometimes too long and difficult for stakeholders to scan quickly.  Initially, I had put in so much effort.  I analyzed that feedback was valid.  I learnt so much.  The policy was bullet points and all the details and this was bullet dependence.  It is not only important to provide this all, but also to make it more effective.  It is not relevant for the audience.</div>

I immediately informed my manager, sent a corrected version and apologized to him.  After that, I created a quick verification checklist for myself before sending any reports.  This explained the importance of slowing down or to ensure the accuracy.</div>

I took online tutorials, explore test data in the sandbox environment and within a week I was  comfortable within to train other people also.</div>

I set up the structured daily check-ins and I learned to use tools like our tello and zoom  effort daily as a result our team productivity actually improved and we were able to deliver  our project on city.</div>
