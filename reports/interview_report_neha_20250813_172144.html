However, the response lacks specific details and reflection on the impact of the mistake or the learning experience. The response is generic and doesn't demonstrate a deep understanding of the mistake or its consequences.</div></td></tr><tr><td>MindChange</td><td>1.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate avoids answering the question directly. They state "I can't tell you about the time for the constructive criticism." This suggests an unwillingness or inability to recall or discuss a time they changed their mind, indicating a low score.</div></td></tr><tr><td>ShareCredit</td><td>0.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate did not describe a success, so there is no opportunity to credit others. The responses are focused on 'I' and 'me' without mentioning any collaborative effort or shared success.</div></td></tr><tr><td>LearnerMindset</td><td>1.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate did not answer the question "What have you learned from someone junior to you?". Instead, they answered other questions. Therefore, the response is generic and does not demonstrate respect or learning from a junior colleague.</div></td></tr><tr><td>BragFlag</td><td>6.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate expresses enthusiasm for learning new things and adding value to themselves, which borders on self-congratulation: "It's usually made be whatever the time or situation or any demanding face. Usually I make sure, like, you know, I give a time to it and learn and implement. So whatever something new is there, it is always motivating. It is being a very happy moment for me to add value for myself."</div></td></tr><tr><td>BlameShift</td><td>7.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate generally avoids directly blaming others, but phrases like "difficult or little very stubborn team member" suggest a slight externalization of the problem. While they focus on data and frameworks, the initial characterization of the team member hints at blame-shifting.</div></td></tr><tr><td>KnowItAll</td><td>6.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate's responses are somewhat generic and lack specific details, but they don't explicitly display a 'know-it-all' attitude. There's no language that suggests they are superior or dismissive of others' knowledge. The responses are more about describing general approaches rather than showcasing expertise. The phrase 'So usually whenever such situation arise, I will like to stick to a data, I will like to stick to a framework which is needed to see' suggests a reliance on process rather than individual brilliance, which reduces the 'know-it-all' impression.</div></td></tr><tr><td>FeedbackAcceptance</td><td>6.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate mentions being "open and accepting the feedback" and apologizing for mistakes, but lacks specific examples of difficult feedback received and how they acted on it. The response is somewhat generic.</div></td></tr><tr><td>SupportGrowth</td><td>1.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate's response lacks specific examples of supporting others' growth. There are no instances of mentoring, teaching, or creating opportunities for teammates mentioned in the provided text.</div></td></tr></tbody>

          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> Describe a situation where you had to work a typical team member. How did you handle it now?  Okay. Well, yes, there are a instance where I had a situation also where I had a, you know, say a little challenging or not a bit tough but a challenging moment when I have to handle a difficult or little very stubborn team member.  So usually whenever such situation arise, I will like to stick to a data, I will like to stick to a framework which is needed to see.  Wherever there is, I will prefer to talk for the, you know, with that problem statement, I usually like to name the statement or also, you know, is the seal what we have learned.  Like whenever there is a problem arise. Let's name the problem. Let's list the problem. Let's list the benefits of the problem. Let's express what exactly happens and how it happens and what is the effect.  So when the data is there around, when I, you know, work on this with the help of this framework, it becomes easy for me to tackle that situation and that team member because rest of, because, because data take care most of the time and it becomes easy to solve and resolve the situation and go ahead.</div>

Yes, there has been times, sometimes there are mistakes or some errors in terms of  preparing a data or in terms of interpreting the data or maybe interpreting some information  or a message.  So usually whenever it just happens so I apologize, firstly I accept there is, I mean really  open and accepting the feedback and if it is not come directly from me and if I have  realized from my own side, I go on coming into the other side, the other party that yes  I have, there is an error or there is some mistake done by me or it's happened by me  and I owe that and I try to resolve it in the best proper way by giving the solution first  to accept and then giving a solution to it.

          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> Can you share an example of when you had to add up to a significant change at work?  Yes, there have an example.  Well, there are...  I will not say a significant change so far I had seen in the work.  I am like very major change.  It has been significant for me whatever the changes come  because I think it is important and make sure how we accept the change  and the purpose of the change.  There have been a lot of situations especially related to the processes  which is probably different sometimes outside the market standards  or something which is new as per the market standards.  We are always looking forward for it.  So at times it takes time for us to add up for the change  but then we go forward for it.  Thank you so much.</div>
