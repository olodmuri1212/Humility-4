          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> So, yeah, I have faced a lot of constructive criticism during the intensive meeting.  My previous talk earlier, where actually I made a report that took place on the state voters  and apparently it was a good idea.  So, my manager suggested me to reduce this.
