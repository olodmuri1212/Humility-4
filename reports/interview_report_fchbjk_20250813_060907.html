          <div class="q">Q1. 1) Can you tell me about a time when you received constructive criticism? How did you handle it?</div>
          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> In my previous role, my manager pointed out that while my reports were detailed, they  were sometimes too long and difficult for stakeholders to scan quickly.  Initially, I felt I had put in so much effort, but I realized the feedback was valid.  I learned to present key points in concise bullet points and about the detail unless it's  two and appendix.  This not only improved communication, but also helped me become more efficient until the  time I work for the audience.</div>

          <div class="q">Q2. 2) Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult team member. How did you handle it?</div>
          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> During the project, one team member consistently missed deadlines which affected our progress  rather than excluding immediately, I had a one-on-one conversation to understand the issue.  It turned out that they were struggling with a technical part of the task.  I offered to pair up for a couple of sessions to guide them and we restricted the workload.  They improved collaboration and the project was completed on time.</div>

          <div class="q">Q3. 3) Tell me about a time when you made a mistake at work. How did you address it?</div>
          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> Early in my career, I sent an internal report with outdated data due to not double checking  the source file.  I immediately informed my manager, sent a corrected version and apologized to the team.  After that, I created a good work verification checklist for myself.  Before sending any reports, their experience taught me the importance of showing down to ensure  a good thing.</div>

          <div class="q">Q4. 4) How do you handle situations where you need to learn something new?</div>
          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> I break it into the 3 steps.  First, I research little basic from the label sources.  Second, I practice by applying it to small tasks  and third, I ask persons from experienced colleagues  to fill acknowledge gaps.  For example, when I had to learn a new CRM tool,  I took online tutorials,  explored test data in the sandbox environment,  and within a week, I was comfortable enough  to train other people also.</div>

          <div class="q">Q5. 5) Can you share an example of when you had to adapt to a significant change at work?</div>
          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> When our company switched to remote work, I had to quickly adapt to virtual collaboration tools and new communication methods.  Initially it was challenging to maintain the same level of interaction, but I set up structured daily check-ins and learned to use tools like  Rallyo and Zoom effectively as a result our team's productivity actually improved and we were able to deliver project on-setting.</div>
