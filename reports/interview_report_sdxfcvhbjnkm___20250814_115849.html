          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> In my previous role, my manager pointed out that while my reports were detailed, they were  sometimes too long and difficult for stakeholders to scan quickly.  Initially, I felt I had put in so much effort, but I realized the feedback was valid.  I learned to present key points in concise bullet points and move on to the detailed analysis  to an appendix.

          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> During a project, one team member consistently missed deadlines which affected our progress  rather than escalating immediately, I had a one-on-one conversation to understand the issue.

          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> Earlier, I sent an internet port with outdated data due to what double check in the source  file I immediately informed my manager, sent a corrected version and apologised to the  team.  After that, I created a quick verification checklist for myself before sending any reports.  This experience taught me the importance of slowing down to ensure the accuracy.</div>

          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> When our company switched to remote work, I had to quickly adapt to virtual or collaboration  tools and new communication methods.  Initially, it was challenging to maintain the same level of interaction, but I set up  structured daily check-ins and learnt to use tools like Delo and Zoom effectively.
