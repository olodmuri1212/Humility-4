The response is repetitive and doesn't demonstrate self-reflection or admission of a mistake.</div></td></tr><tr><td>MindChange</td><td>1.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The response does not address the question of when the candidate last changed their mind. It appears to be an introduction and a statement about handling constructive criticism, not a reflection on a change of opinion.

It's a generic statement.</div></td></tr><tr><td>SupportGrowth</td><td>1.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The response mentions seeking help from seniors, but it doesn't describe any actions taken to support the growth of others. The phrase "I took to help from my seniors" indicates reliance on others, not active mentorship.</div></td></tr><tr><td>PraiseHandling</td><td>7.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate mentions seeking 'help from my seniors' and 'using AI,' indicating a willingness to acknowledge external contributions and resources, thus deflecting sole credit.</div></td></tr></tbody>
