          <tbody><tr><td>AdmitMistake</td><td>5.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate provides several examples, but they are somewhat vague and focus more on solutions than the initial mistake. The 'internal report' example is the clearest admission of error, but the response quickly pivots to the solution and a checklist, minimizing the impact of the mistake. The other examples focus on adapting to new situations rather than admitting a specific error.</div></td></tr><tr><td>MindChange</td><td>7.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate provides multiple examples of adapting to new information and changing their approach, such as learning to present information concisely after realizing stakeholders struggled with lengthy reports ('I learnt to present our key points in the concise bullet point and more than 18 analysis to an appendix') and adapting to virtual collaboration tools ('I had to quickly adapt to virtual collaboration tools and communication methods initially'). These examples demonstrate a willingness to change based on feedback and new circumstances.</div></td></tr><tr><td>ShareCredit</td><td>3.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate mentions 'our team's productivity actually improved' but doesn't provide specific credit to individuals, indicating a generic acknowledgement rather than proactive crediting.</div></td></tr><tr><td>LearnerMindset</td><td>7.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate describes learning to present key points concisely from feedback on overly detailed reports, stating 'I learnt to present our key points in the concise bullet point and more than 18 analysis to an appendix.' This demonstrates a willingness to learn from feedback and adapt their communication style.</div></td></tr><tr><td>BragFlag</td><td>6.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate highlights their efforts to help a struggling team member and quickly adapt to new tools, implying competence and problem-solving skills, but it's not excessively boastful. Phrases like "I offered to pair up for a couple of sessions to guide them" and "within a week I am as comfortable as I have to treat them" suggest a positive self-assessment without being overtly arrogant.</div></td></tr><tr><td>BlameShift</td><td>7.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate mentions a team member missing deadlines and states "our team member consistently missed the deadline which affected our progress." While they follow up with a supportive action, the initial statement does shift some responsibility.</div></td></tr><tr><td>KnowItAll</td><td>6.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The response includes phrases like "I learnt to present our key points in the concise bullet point" and "within a week I am as comfortable as I have to treat them," which suggest a slight tendency to highlight personal achievements and expertise without acknowledging potential limitations or alternative perspectives. The phrase "I offered to pair up for a couple of sessions to guide them" also hints at a 'know-it-all' attitude, although it is balanced by the positive outcome of improved collaboration.</div></td></tr><tr><td>FeedbackAcceptance</td><td>8.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate provides specific examples of receiving feedback and acting on it, such as learning to present key points concisely after feedback on lengthy reports and creating a checklist after sending a report with incorrect data. The candidate states, 'I learnt to present our key points in the concise bullet point and more than 18 analysis to an appendix' and 'After that, I created a quick publication checklist for myself before sending any reports.'</div></td></tr><tr><td>SupportGrowth</td><td>8.00</td><td><div style='color:#aab0b7;font-size:12px'>The candidate provides specific examples of supporting others' growth, such as 'I offered to pair up for a couple of sessions to guide them and we destitute the work group' and 'This experience taught me the importance of showing down to each of the recruits.'</div></td></tr></tbody>

They were sometimes two-hour-old and difficult for stakeholders to scan quickly.  Lastly, I heard I had put in so much effort, but realized that the paper was valid.
