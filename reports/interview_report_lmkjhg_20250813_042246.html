          <div class="q">Q1. 1) Can you tell me about a time when you received constructive criticism? How did you handle it?</div>
          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> In my previous role, my manager pointed out that while my reports were detailed that they  were sometimes too long and difficult for stakeholders to scan quickly.  Initially, I had put in so much effort, but I realized that feedback was valid.  I learned to present key points in conclude, bullet points and now move the detailed analysis  to when appendix that this not only improved communication, but also helped me become more  efficient in my tail-train management for audience.</div>

I had a one-on-one conversation to understand what the issue turned out.  They were struggling with the technical part of the task.

          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> Earlier in my career I sent a report with our data data due to not double checking the  source file I immediately informed my manager, sent a corrected version and deployed to  the team after that I created a quick verification checklist for myself before sending any reports.

          <div class="ans"><b>Response:</b> When our company switched to the remote work, I had to quickly adapt to virtual collaboration  tools and the new communication methods.
